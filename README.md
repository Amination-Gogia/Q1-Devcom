First fork this repository on your github account

Kindly ensure internet connectivity for loading of images and connecting of Bootstrap CDN for best experience.

Also please do rename the "homePage" folder to "home-page" for the hyperlink to work; there was some error showing up on my PC about special characters..., due to which I had to change the name of the folder
